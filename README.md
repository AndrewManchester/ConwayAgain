# Conway's Game of Life
Uses React, Bulma and xstate

I wanted to make the game fully flexible.
Changing variables will change the number of
rows or columns, iteration speed etc.

The actual game of life lends itself to javascripts
map and reduce functions. So if your game is represented
as an array of arrays this may be interesting to you.

The response to cell clicks is a little sluggish and gets
slower as you increase the grid size.

There is a link on the right of this page to a CodeSandbox.io demo

Bulma has been used for the html. Could be improved.

Use of xstate has greatly simplified the logic
controlling the state of the buttons.
